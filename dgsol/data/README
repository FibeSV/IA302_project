There are 5 data sets in this directory. 
Each data set is drawn from distance data for a protein.
If delta_{i,j} is the distance between atoms i and j, then

  l_{i,j} = delta_{i,j}(1 - epsilon)
  u_{i,j} = delta_{i,j}(1 - epsilon)

for some epsilon with 0 < epsilon < 1.
In general we only include short range distances in the data.

Additional data can be obtained from the PDB data bank at Brookhaven.
