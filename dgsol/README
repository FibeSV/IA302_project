           INSTRUCTIONS FOR SEQUENTIAL VERSION
          
The compressed tar file dgsol.tar.gz contains the dgsol
package for distance geometry problems.

1. Create the dgsol directory structure with

       gzip -d dgsol.tar.gz
       tar -xvf dgsol.tar

   This produces the directory dgsol and several subdirectories.

2. Set the environment variable DG_ARCH with one of the following:

       setenv DG_ARCH linux 
       setenv DG_ARCH rs6000 
       setenv DG_ARCH IRIX64

   This environment variable is needed because we mix Fortran and C code.
 
3. Change directories to dgsol and install the dgsol libraries with
 
       make libs

4. Create the executable dgsol with
   
       make exec
 
   in the subdirectory dgsol_s.

4. Run the sample program with
 
       dgsol -s3

   Compare the output in dg.sum with the output in the sample
   output file dg.linux.

           INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARALLEL VERSION
          
The compressed tar file dgsol.tar.gz contains the dgsol
package for distance geometry problems.

1. Create the dgsol directory structure with

       gzip -d dgsol.tar.gz
       tar -xvf dgsol.tar

   This produces the directory dgsol and several subdirectories.

2. Set the environment variable DG_ARCH with one of the following:

       setenv DG_ARCH sun4 
       setenv DG_ARCH rs6000 
       setenv DG_ARCH IRIX64

   This environment variable is needed because we mix Fortran and C code.

3. The parallel version of DGSOL requires support for the MPICH message
   passing library. This requires setting several environment variables
   before making dgsol:
  
       setenv CC mpicc
       setenv FC mpif77

   The command mpirun must also be in your path. In most installations
   this command can be found is

       /usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun

   A machine file dg.machines.<DG_ARCH> also needs to be created in the drivers
   directory containing the list of machines for the parallel execution.
 
4. Change directories to dgsol and install the dgsol libraries with
 
       make libs

5. Create the executable dgsol with
   
       make exec
 
   in the subdirectory dgsol_p. The LIBS definition of the Makefile in this 
   directory may need to be modified to add libraries needed for MPICH, or 
   to resolve external references.

6. Run the sample program with
 
       mpirun -np 3 dgsol -s3

   Compare the output in dg.sum with the output in the sample
   output file dg.linux.

   The command mpirun -np 3 dgsol -s3 uses 3 processors to run dgsol -s3.
   If we want to run on a specific set of machines we can use, for example,

       mpirun -np 3 -machinefile dg_mach dgsol -s6

   to use 3 processors (specified in dg_mach) to run dgsol -s6. 
   Consult the mpich user guide for more information on mpirun.
