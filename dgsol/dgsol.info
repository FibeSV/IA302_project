DGSOL solves the distance geometry problem of finding positions
 x_1,...,x_n for atoms that satisfy the distance contraints

      l_{i,j} <= || x_i - x_j || <= u_{i,j}

DGSOL uses a global continuation algorithm, with Gaussian smoothing
of a merit function that only depends on the sparse distance
data. Several minimizers are traced in the continuation process, and
the best minimizer is selected as the global minimizer.  In the
current release of DGSOL, a variable-metric limited-memory code is
used to trace the minimizers. More robust algorithms will be added
in future releases. For additional information on this approach, see

===================
DGSOL documentation
===================

  dgsol [-a#na] [-d#nd] [-s#ns] [input output summary]

where

  na = number of atoms

  nd = number of distances

  ns = number of solutions desired

  input = name of file with distance data

  output = name of file for solution coordinates

  summary = name of file for a summary of the optimization process

The summary file provides the following information

   n_atoms      Number of atoms
    n_dist      Number of distances
     f_err      The value of the merit function
  derr_min      The smallest error in the distances  
  derr_avg      The average error in the distances
  derr_max      The largest error in the distances

The error in the distances is defined by

  r_{i,j} = || x_i - x_j ||
  errl    = min{ (r_{i,j} - l_{i,j})/l_{i,j}, 0 }
  erru    = max{ (r_{i,j} - u_{i,j})/u_{i,j}, 0 }
  err     = max{ errl, erru }

The merit function is defined as the sum of terms of the form:

  min^2 { r_{i,j}^2 - l_{i,j}^2 )/l_{i,j}^2, 0 } 
  max^2 { r_{i,j}^2 - u_{i,j}^2 )/u_{i,j}^2, 0 }


The file dg.data in the dgsol_s and dgsol_p directories contains
sample data for DGSOL.  This data is identical with the data in
data/data_set_1/graph.01.data 

Additional test data is included in the directory data.  
The README file in that directory describes the data.
